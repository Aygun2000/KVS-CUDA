KVS-CUDA: Key-Value Store Using CUDA
KVS-CUDA is a high-performance key-value store designed for efficient key insertion and lookup using NVIDIA's CUDA technology. This project demonstrates how leveraging GPU parallelism can significantly accelerate database operations compared to traditional CPU-based approaches.

Overview
In large-scale databases, fast key-value retrieval is essential. Consider a scenario where a company manages a database of 1,000,000 game keys. When a user purchases a key, it must be quickly assigned and verified. Traditionally, this process relied on CPU computation, which could become a bottleneck for large datasets.

By utilizing CUDA and NVIDIA GPUs, we can achieve much faster key lookups and insertions, taking advantage of the superior parallel processing power of GPUs.

A detailed presentation is available in the repository.
